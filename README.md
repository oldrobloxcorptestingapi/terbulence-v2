To get started its pretty easy you need pnpm which can be installed by running: `npm i -g pnpm` and then just need to the run following command
```
pnpm i && pnpm start
```
    
and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you should be good to go!

If you wish to not start the server with the Bare Server Functionality you can just run `pnpm run dev`, its highly recommended to just run `pnpm start`

> If you are going to static host Terbium you will need to change the bare server and you would not follow those steps. Refer to the [docs](https://github.com/z1g-project/Terbium/wiki/Deploy-to-Cloudflare-Pages) for more information
